    <h3>You don't need us to wax lyrical about the beauty of the Bahamas. But on Harbour Island, there's one place we'd be remiss to leave off this list of the world's beautiful places. Pink Sand Beach is a firm feature on many bucket lists – a gorgeous powdery stretch of blush-coloured sand where ribbons of blue waters ebb and flow on one side while palm trees sway in the breeze on the other.</h3><br>
