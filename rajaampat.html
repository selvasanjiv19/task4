    <h3>This glorious archipelago can be found in the Coral Triangle, an area that lies between Indonesia, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea and the Philippines. Famous for being one of the most biodiverse marine habitats in the world, Raja Ampat is as beautiful below ground as it is above it. Come for days spent snorkelling among rainbow-coloured fish and bright coral reefs, or keep your head above water for the birds – hornbills, cockatoos, sea eagles, to name a few. It's a nature-lovers paradise.</h3>
